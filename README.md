# foodApp
This is my simple portfolio web application created with React.
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

To run the project, make sure you are in the project directory, then install it locally using npm

``
$ npm install
``

and run your development mode:

``
$ npm start
``

### Features

You are able add some of available meals to the cart and once You're done You can actually place an order and send the order data to the server.
In this case I used firebase as a live -test database
